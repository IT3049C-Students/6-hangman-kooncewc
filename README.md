## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
15/20

## Self-Reflection:
Game not fully functioning, but all of the code is in, I believe it is an issue with my start button and the way I call the functions(? I was unable to determine what exactly it was). The word is being pulled when I check the developer settings, but the game does not start or track my history when I start to guess. I can log the word but the game doesn't seem to do anything when I start it aside from refresh the page. I set the button to prevent default action and tried to figure out why exactly it still refreshes on start, but was unable to determine what exactly causes it.

### How long it took me to finish this?
5 hours
